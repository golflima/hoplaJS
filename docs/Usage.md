HoplaJS can be used to:

* write single-page JavaScript web applications
* write single HTML pages
* prototype things with JavaScript, CSS and HTML
* share pieces of code
* display things of dashboards (works well with [Dashkiosk](https://github.com/vincentbernat/dashkiosk))
* ...



## How it works

**HoplaJS allows you create web JavaScript applications.** *It's free, you keep your data, nothing will be stored on our servers, and, it's open-source.*

To create a new HoplaJS JavaScript web application, all you have to do is :

1. Go on hoplajs.golflima.net, [HTTP](http://hoplajs.golflima.net) or [HTTPS](https://hoplajs.golflima.net)
2. Write the JavaScript to execute in the field *JavaScript to execute:*
3. If your script requires other JavaScript files, add them in the field *Dependencies of JavaScript to execute:*, one URL per line
4. If your script requires specific CSS style (inside `<head><style></style></head>`), add it in the field *CSS style to apply:*
5. If your script requires specific HTML content (inside `<body></body>`), add it in the field *HTML body content to display and manipulate:*
6. When everything is ready, you can push the button *Generate the HoplaJS URLs for this script !*
7. As soon as URLs are generated, you'll see a gauge to measure it's size
   * *green* means the URL will be usable on every browsers (URLs length up to 2048 characters)
   * *orange* means the URL won't be usable on some browsers (URLs with more than 2048 characters, but less than 8000)
   * *red* means the URL won't be usable at all (URLs with more than 8000 characters)
     * To reduce the URL length, you can try to check the boxes *Minify JavaScript* and *Minify HTML Body*, but keep a non-minified version somewhere to easely update your HoplaJS script later
8. Last but not least, you'll then get 3 URLs, and buttons to *copy* them in your clipboard or to *open* them in a new window/tab:
   * *Run* is the URL to start your application, the `.html` page on which your script will be executed
   * *Raw* is the URL to your script, the `.js` file containing all your JavaScript, to be included in a bookmark or in a page
   * *Edit* is the URL to edit your application, it will display HolpaJS edit form with prefilled fields

**Please keep in mind that your whole HoplaJS application is stored inside the generated URL: if you loose it, you loose your entire application too.**

*You only need to keep either the Run or the Raw URL as they both contains a link to edit back the HoplaJS application in comments.*



## No Data Stored Policy

HoplaJS won't store the content generated by users on its server. Users must remember their generated URLs to retrieve their content.
