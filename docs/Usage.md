# ![](../web/assets/images/favicon_32.png) hoplaJS - User Manual

HoplaJS can be used to:

* write single-page JavaScript web applications
* write single HTML pages
* prototype things with JavaScript, CSS and HTML
* share pieces of code
* display things of dashboards (works well with [Dashkiosk](https://github.com/vincentbernat/dashkiosk))
* ...



## How it works

**HoplaJS allows you create web JavaScript applications.** *It's free, you keep your data, nothing will be stored on our servers, and, it's open-source.*

To create a new HoplaJS JavaScript web application, all you have to do is :

1. Go on hoplajs.golflima.net, [HTTP](http://hoplajs.golflima.net) or [HTTPS](https://hoplajs.golflima.net)
2. Write the JavaScript to execute in the field *JavaScript to execute:*
3. If your script requires other JavaScript files, add them in the field *Dependencies of JavaScript to execute:*, one URL per line
4. If your script requires specific CSS style (inside `<head><style></style></head>`), add it in the field *CSS style to apply:*
5. If your script requires specific HTML content (inside `<body></body>`), add it in the field *HTML body content to display and manipulate:*
6. When everything is ready, you can push the button *Generate the HoplaJS URLs for this script !*
7. As soon as URLs are generated, you'll see a gauge to measure it's size
   * *green* means the URL will be usable on every browsers (URLs length up to 2048 characters)
   * *orange* means the URL won't be usable on some browsers (URLs with more than 2048 characters, but less than 8000)
   * *red* means the URL won't be usable at all (URLs with more than 8000 characters)
     * To reduce the URL length, you can try to check the boxes *Minify JavaScript* and *Minify HTML Body*, but keep a non-minified version somewhere to easely update your HoplaJS script later
8. Last but not least, you'll then get 3 URLs, and buttons to *copy* them in your clipboard or to *open* them in a new window/tab:
   * *Run* is the URL to start your application, the `.html` page on which your script will be executed
   * *Raw* is the URL to your script, the `.js` file containing all your JavaScript, to be included in a bookmark or in a page
   * *Edit* is the URL to edit your application, it will display HolpaJS edit form with prefilled fields

**Please keep in mind that your whole HoplaJS application is stored inside the generated URL: if you loose it, you loose your entire application too.**

*You only need to keep either the Run or the Raw URL as they both contains a link to edit back the HoplaJS application in comments.*



## Bypass [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), [Mixed content](https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/) issues

Modern web browsers prevent websites to execute code and use resources from other websites, mainly for security considerations. Unfortunately, these behaviors may break many JavaScript code.

Since HoplaJS applications are independant single-page applications or prototypes which may require external resources, HoplaJS is shipped with a builtin proxy for external resources.
To use it:

1. Go to the *HoplaJS proxy for external resources* panel
2. Enter the resource URL inside the field *URL*
3. If needed, enter the expected [Content-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the resource in the field *Content-type*
4. Copy the URL generated from the field *Proxy*
5. Use the copied URL in your HoplaJS application



## No Data Stored Policy

HoplaJS won't store the content generated by users on its server. Users must remember their generated URLs to retrieve their content.

It means HoplaJS is not responsible from content generated, and nothing can be done to prevent a content to be displayed, appart of course to not use its associated URL.

Even if HoplaJS doesn't stores the content generated by users, web servers log HTTP requests, and HoplaJS logs some information too.
Since an HoplaJS application is contained inside the URL, it may so be logged on the server and accessible from the system administrators for debug / legal purpose.
It won't be available publicly, but we recommend to not use any sensitive data inside an HoplaJS application for this reason.
